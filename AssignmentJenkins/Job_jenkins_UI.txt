--Use Jenkins UI to create the job--
Step 1: First, create a job at Jenkins dashboard.
Step 2: Choose the style and then click ok.
Step 3: Now configure job by selecting a source from the local system or from version control system as GitHub or subversion.
Step 4: Use the Build option 
		Select Windows batch command //if the system is windows.
		Select Execute shell //if the system is Ubuntu.
Step 5: Post-build options can also be added which means if a job builds successfully what to do next after it.
Step 6: Click on apply and save.
Step 7: Click on the build now and see console output.

For example -If want to execute java program then,
			 Choose file from git 
			 Select execute windows batch command from build option and
			 type cd c:\\users\\path_to_program_location
			 javac file_name.java
			 java file_name
	
			 Click on apply and save 
			 Build the project and see the output on console of Jenkins.
			 
So, in this manner, we can create a job using Jenkins UI
